<p class="p3"><span class="s2">When you use </span>Hyper Security<span class="s2"> services, our servers automatically record certain information about your mobile device. This information may include an equipment identifier (e.g., IMEI, UDID), Mac address, subscriber identifier (e.g., IMSI), device name, mobile phone number, device type and manufacturer, operating system type and version, wireless carrier / operator, network type, country of origin, Internet Protocol (“IP”) address, and the dates and times of your requests.

<p class="p2"><span class="s2">4. Information about scans and scan results</span></p>

They also automatically scan your entire device periodically, and regularly update your threat definitions. In order to perform these functions, we need to collect information about the applications and files present on your device, the results of any scans performed by our services, and actions you take as a result of scanning.</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">5. Safe Browsing / URLs</span></p>

If a URL you visit is determined to be unsafe, we store a record of the unsafe URL.</span></p>
